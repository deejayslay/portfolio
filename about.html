			<h2>My Journey</h2>	
		<p> My journey to wanting to pursue a front-end development career has been a long but difficult journey. Enterting college, I chose to major in Software Engineering, mainly because the major looked really appealing. Really appealing, I say, but appealing only on the outside: the high-paying jobs, the demand of SE jobs, the prestige of the Software Engineering title.</p>
		<p>Thus, it was really easy for me to want to give up, as there was a lack of a passion for SE. And so for my first three years at UCI were me just going back and forth, looking for the right major. From Civil Engineering to Economics, just to come back full-circle to Software Engineering again in the beginning of my third year. I was worried that I was yet again falling into the trap of following a career path I had no desire in. I even took one programming my course my second year at UCI, and outright failed it.</p>
		<p>Thankfully, though, this past summer, I have researched on the CS-related jobs out there in the market and waas first introduced to Front-End Development. From there on out, I have grown to enjoy front-end development and have committed to a career in the field</p>
		<p>I hope this inspires anyone who ever has doubts about their Computer Science degree. Fortunately, there are many sub-fields in Computer Science that I can be sure you will enjoy at least one of them. </p>

		<h2>Now</h2>
		<p>I am currently a 4th-year Computer Science major at the UCI, set to graduate in the Spring 2021. </p>

		<h2>Other Interesting Facts</h2>
		<p>I really enjoy music, as I love to sing and am really fond of karaoke nights. I also am one of the leaders of a Catholic club at UCI.</p>
